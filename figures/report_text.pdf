POK√âMON ANALYSIS REPORT (2025)
==============================

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of Pok√©mon data collected from the PokeAPI in 2025.
It explores the relationships between key battle statistics (HP, Attack, Defense, Speed)
and compares their distributions across Pok√©mon types.

A total of 20 Pok√©mon were analyzed, covering 6 unique types.
Each Pok√©mon‚Äôs overall Power Score was calculated as the sum of HP, Attack, and Defense.

üî• The strongest Pok√©mon found in this dataset is *Blastoise* (Fairy-type)
with a total Power Score of 262 (HP: 79, Attack: 83, Defense: 100).

Average statistics per type are summarized below (see ‚Äúfigures/summary_by_type.csv‚Äù).
The bar chart 'avg_power_by_type.png' visualizes which Pok√©mon types tend to dominate in terms of raw power ‚Äî
for instance, Dragon- and Rock-type Pok√©mon often show higher total scores compared to Fairy or Grass types.

The correlation heatmap ('correlation_heatmap.png') highlights the relationships between combat stats.
It suggests a moderate positive correlation between Attack and Defense,
indicating that Pok√©mon with strong offensive abilities often have balanced defenses as well.

Meanwhile, the scatterplot ('power_vs_speed.png') reveals an interesting trade-off between Power and Speed.
Fast Pok√©mon (like Electric types) often sacrifice total power for agility,
while slower ones (like Rock or Ground types) have much higher combined HP and Attack.

Finally, the pairplot provides a full statistical overview, showing how each attribute interacts with others.
These relationships can guide future modeling ‚Äî for instance, predicting power levels or identifying outliers
based on multiple metrics.

In summary, this 2025 Pok√©mon analysis demonstrates how data visualization and aggregation
can uncover trends within large-scale character datasets.
